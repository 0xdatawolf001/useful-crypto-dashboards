# List of (Niche) Crypto Dashboards

This document saves the list of crypto dashboards and analytics sites that contain useful information about particular crypto products (chains, protocols etc). They are typically a good mix of offchain data and therefore are not as commoditized; making them rarer than usual. This makes them worth saving! 

## Criteria on Inclusion
The criteria for inclusion is very simple: the website is widely reference and contains important KPIs that sets the standard that the ecosystem as a whole should work towards. 
I avoid adding:
- Community curated dashboards
- Block explorers and scanners
- Direct data providers

Note that the list and categories aren't the most granular or MECE in the world but I'll adjust it on the fly where it gets messy
