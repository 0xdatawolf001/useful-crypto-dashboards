# List of Crypto Dashboards

This document saves the list of crypto dashboards and analytics sites that contain useful information about particular crypto products (chains, protocols etc)

## Criteria on Inclusion
The criteria for inclusion is very simple: the website is widely reference and contains important KPIs that sets the standard that the ecosystem as a whole should work towards. 

## Main

1. [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary): This measures some growth metrics of L2s but most importantly measures the degree of decentralization on the L2
2. [DefiScan](https://www.defiscan.info/): Something like L2 beat but for protocols
3. [Vaults FYI](https://www.growthepie.xyz/): This contains the overall value that the L2s contains
4. [Rollup](https://rollup.wtf/): This measures the throughput of a L2 chain
5. [RWA](https://www.rwa.xyz/): This measures the RWA market size
6. [Vaults](https://www.vaults.fyi/): Yields for tokens across the EVM
7. [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/): General purpose analytics site to find TVL related data and changes
8. [Client Diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/): Measures the diversity and dominance of various consensus and execution clients
9. [Super majority risk](https://supermajority.info/): An alternate site to Client Diversity
10. [Ultra Sound Money](https://ultrasound.money/): Measures Ethereum's issuance, relative valuation, and gas use
11. [Optimism Ecosystem Wide Dashboard](https://community.optimism.io/welcome/faq/dashboard-trackers): List of dashboards used to track the various Optimism Ecosystem related metrics

## For Fun
12. [Sorella](https://sorellalabs.xyz/dashboard): Get motion sickness from seeing how blocks get made
13. [Ethernow](https://www.ethernow.xyz/mempool/all): Another site to see how blocks are getting made
14. [KYCNOT ME](https://kycnot.me/): Find services that do not use KYC and their risk levels
15. [Tx Street](https://txstreet.com/): Watch transactions as people taking a bus (block) live streamed to show normies that transactions are very real in Ethereum and not an abstract concept

## Note
This list is made for me and definitely isn't authoritiative. I just want to store links somewhere lol
